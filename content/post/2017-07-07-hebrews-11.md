> 33 who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,  
> 34 quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.  
> 35 Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life.  
> 36 Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.  
> 37 They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword. They went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated— 38 of whom the world was not worthy—wandering about in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.

There were people who by faith **&#8220;…escaped the edge of the sword…&#8221;** (Heb.10:34)  
There were people who by faith **&#8220;…were killed with the sword…&#8221;** (Heb.10:37)  
there is no controversy here&#8230;  
Both are heroes of faith  
So, do not be one-sided in your faith, thinking that the way of faith is **always** escaping the edge of the sword or always death from the sword.  
As we see from this text everyone has its own way of faith &#8230;
