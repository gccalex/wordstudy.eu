Acts chapter one...
Jesus presents Himself alive to His disciples - what was the first thing He was speaking to them about? 

The Kingdom of God! 

He spoke to them about the same thing as before. Nothing new. 

If Jesus would appear to you today I'm sure Hes message would never change. 

Eternal Salvation
