> <sup>17</sup> So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.

Faith comes from hearing  &#8211; upon reading this, you may think: &#8220;Ok, I will start hearing&#8221; &#8211; and you hear, hear and hear the Word&#8230; but&#8230;  
Read further &#8230;. &#8220;have they not heard&#8221;

People of Israel have heard a lot! But it does not produce faith in them. Why?

in addition to your hearing of the Word, you need to add something else&#8230; What? Let&#8217;s see what the Scripture says:

> Romans 10:21  
> <sup>21</sup> But of Israel he says, “All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”

Israel of old, had the Word of God and they heard the Word of God a lot, but it turns out, that it is possible to hear the Word a lot and still be  &#8220;&#8230;disobedient and contrary people&#8230;&#8221;

So add some heart qualities to your hearing.
