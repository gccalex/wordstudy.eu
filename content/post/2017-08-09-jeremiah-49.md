> <sup>20</sup> Therefore hear the plan that the Lord has made against Edom and the purposes that he has formed against the inhabitants of Teman: Even the little ones of the flock shall be dragged away. Surely their fold shall be appalled at their fate.

  
Edom, what happened!? Why is it, that the plan of God is so heavily against you Edom?  What is so wrong with you that causes that harsh reaction from God Himself?

  
The heat of the matter is the Edoms attitude towards his brother &#8230;Israel.  
Jacob and Esau. Israel and Edom.

  
Edom rejoiced over the desolation of Israel.



> <sup>14</sup> Thus says the Lord God: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate. <sup>15</sup> As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will deal with you; you shall be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it. Then they will know that I am the Lord.

  
What is the conclusion? Have an attitude and the heart to be different, do not rejoice when another person falls.
